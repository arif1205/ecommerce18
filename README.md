## Work Flow

User registers in the website with personal details and bank information. User can see all the products in home screen and add chosen products to the cart. User can place an order and orders summary is visible to the user. Then User has to pay for the order.<br>
User pays the required amount to the E-Commerce through the bank API. Then bank API returns the transaction number. After that an invoice is generated with the order details and user can view or download the invoice.<br>
E-Commerce pays the supplier through the bank API and bank API returns a transaction number. E-Commerce then sends a delivery request to the supplier API with the transaction number and ordered products.
<br>
Supplier verifies the transaction through the bank API. If the transaction is verified, supplier delivers the product to the user and sends the delivery status to the E-Commerce.
